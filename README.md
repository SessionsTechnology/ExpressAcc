<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->
* Currently stands as MVP for at least the user portion to check out and in items.

ExpressACC started as an idea for my kids to be able to manage their own time on devices. Instead of parents managing multiple kids and devices, the kids can manage their own time. It also includes an admin dashboard for parents/admins to be able to monitor time left. The goal is for this to expand to other places outside the home, such as school, church, etc.

As of right now, this is being built as a self-hosted docker container. I plan hosting a cloud solution in the near future.

This is a work in progress and is not ready for production use. I am not responsible for any damage or loss of data. Use at your own risk.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

#### Work in progress... Keep in mind things may change quickly.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Mac, Linux, or Windows WSL
* Nodejs >= 16.0.0
* Docker (recommended)
* Docker-compose (recommended)

### Installation

<!-- 1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com) -->
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SessionsTechnology/ExpressAcc.git && cd ExpressAcc
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm run setup
   ```
3. Run the app
   ```js
   npm run dev
   ```

The above steps will currently run the application with a default port of 3001 locally. If you wish to run the app in docker, you can run the following command to build the docker image and run the container.

```sh
docker build -t expressacc:latest . && docker run -d -p 3001:3001 expressacc:latest
```

You can also create a volume to persist the data. This will allow you to update the container without losing your data.

```sh
docker build -t expressacc:latest . && docker run -d -p 3001:3001 -v expressacc-data:/app/lowdb expressacc:latest
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. As you start the app, you will see an error in the console `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'find')`. This will continue to log until you go to the app in your browser and run the first setup (simple two fields for now).

2. Once you have completed the setup, you will see two buttons, one for Checkout and one for Admin. You can click on the Admin button to see the admin dashboard. The admin dashboard will show you the current time left for each user (more functionality to come). There is a settings button that will take you to the settins page.

3. The settings page will allow you to setup how much time each weekday a 'User' will have for items marked as 'Timed', add new users, and add new items.

4. From here you can go to the Checkout screen to allow your 'Users' to checkout items.
